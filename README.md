 a) plotting of a linear regression graph where the relayion bwtween input and labels is closely estimated
 
 b) here a higher order polynomial is used. as the order of the polynomial is increased , the the SSE decreases and the plot tries to capture more data from the training samples. but it leads to overfitting.
 
 c) introduction of Lagrangian multiplier, which decreases the effect of overfitting. Beyond a certain value, the system becomes too regularised and again fails to capture the functional relatonship in the input Labels.

d) similar to problem 2 but variance is included and relation between variance and error is observed.The method of getting the predicted outputs is the same as the method of calculating the weights in the polynomial regression as solving maximum likelihood scenario results in the same solution for the weights matrix. here as the variance of label is changed, the error remains same when more number of training samples are used.

e) Here, the standard deviation sigma and the standard deviation of the weights for the maximum likelihood are observed. as the value of sigma is increased and alpha is decreased, overfitting is decreased and vice versa. relation between Lagrangian multiplier and sigma and alpha.
